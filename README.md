# üöÄ Ansible Home Lab (ALP)

A minimal, ready-to-run **Ansible home lab** showcasing configuration management across Linux and Windows nodes.

For a lab overview: https://letisiapangataa.github.io/posts/home-lab-with-ansible/

## What's inside
- `ansible.cfg` ‚Äî local Ansible configuration
- `inventory/` ‚Äî sample inventory with `linux_servers` and `windows_servers` groups
- `playbooks/` ‚Äî example playbooks:
  - `linux_hardening.yml` ‚Äî UFW + SSH baseline
  - `windows_config.yml` ‚Äî create a local admin user (demo)
  - `nginx.yml` ‚Äî install & manage Nginx on Linux nodes
- `group_vars/all/` ‚Äî global defaults (non-sensitive)
- `roles/common/` ‚Äî example role structure (placeholder)
- `blog/` ‚Äî Markdown blog post explaining how this lab was built

## Quick start
1. Install Ansible on your control node (Linux/macOS).
2. Update `inventory/inventory.ini` with your node IPs/hostnames.
3. Configure SSH for Linux nodes and WinRM for Windows nodes.
4. Run a playbook, e.g.:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/inventory.ini playbooks/linux_hardening.yml
```
or
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/inventory.ini playbooks/nginx.yml
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security note:** Do **not** commit real passwords. Use Ansible Vault for secrets. The Windows example uses a placeholder that you should replace with a vaulted var.

## Using Ansible Vault (example)
Create an encrypted variable file for secrets:
```bash
ansible-vault create group_vars/all/vault.yml
```
Put secrets like:
```yaml
win_local_admin_password: "replace-with-strong-password"
```
Reference vaulted vars in your playbooks. To run with vault:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/inventory.ini playbooks/windows_config.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

## CI (optional)
A simple GitHub Actions workflow runs `ansible-lint` if available. You can remove or expand it as needed.
